# Root Login Check

Check to look for Root login attempts

![aws-services][aws-services-image]


## Installation Options

- [Pipeline](#setup-codepipeline)
- [CloudFormation](#setup-using-cloudformation)

## Prerequisites For Setup

By default, Root login events go to Cloudtrail in us-east-1.  Cloudtrail must be enabled in 'us-east-1' or Cloudtrail for all regions must be enabled in the region where the Root Login check is run.

If this project is deployed in an account that is different from the main account where the Alert System was deployed, we need to add a permission for the account to access the Destination in the main account.

  - Go to the Lambda console of the main account and in the ‘us-east-1’ region

  - Find a function called ‘SungardAS-Alerts- Permission-xxxx’ and configure the test event as below:

  ```javascript
  {
      "region": "<region name where this project is deployed>",
      "account": "<account number where this project is deployed>",
      "destinationName": "<destination name defined in main Alert System; 'alertDestination' if not changed>"
  }
  ```

  - Run Test to execute this lambda function


## Setup CodePipeline

Create a stack using 'codepipeline.yaml' using below input values

Input Parameter Values

- CloudWatchLogDestinationArn:

  Value of `CloudWatchDestinationArn` in 'Outputs' of `SungardAS-aws-services-alerts(-destination)` stack in the main account's `same region` with one where this project is deployed

- CloudWatchLogGroupName:

  Name of a Cloudwatchlog Group where this trigger sends alert messages

- GitHubPersonalAccessToken:

  `Access Token` for CodeBuild to access to the this Github repository. (See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/">here</a> to find how to generate the access token).

- GitHubSourceRepositoryBranch: `master`

- GitHubSourceRepositoryName: `aws-services-alerts-trigger`

- GitHubSourceRepositoryOwner: `SungardAS`

- ProjectImage: `aws/codebuild/python:2.7.12`


## Setup using CloudFormation

### Prep Lambda Code

1. Create a ZIP file of the source code files in RootActivityLambda.  The files should be in the root of the zip file.

2. Upload the file to your favorite S3 bucket



### Crate CloudFormation Stack

Create a Cloudformation stack using 'RootAPIMonitor.yaml' using below input values

Input Parameter Values

- CloudWatchLogDestinationArn:

  ARN of Cloudwatch Log in remote account where Cloudwatch log subscription will send log info.

- CloudWatchLogGroupName:

  Name of a local Cloudwatch Log Group where this trigger sends alert messages

- LambdaTimeout

  Enter a timeout value in seconds for the lambda function. Min is 3, max is 300 and default is 60.

- LambdaS3Bucket:

  Name of the S3 bucket where the lambda function is stored

- LambdaS3Key:

  Name of the S3 key of the Lambda function (include the prefix as well)
